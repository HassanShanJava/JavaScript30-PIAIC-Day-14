    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4=[...players]
    team4[1]='Hassan Shan'
    console.log(team4, players);
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };


    const captin=person;
    // and think we make a copy:
    captin.age=99;
    console.log(person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain=Object.assign({}, person, {number:99})
    console.log(captain, person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    console.log(copy, person);

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    // console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    // Object.assign ONLY does 1 level deep
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // JSON. stringfy turn to string
    // JSON.parse turns to object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
